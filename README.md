Crud Banking API
The CRUD Banking API aims to emulate the server side of a banking webapp. Our webapp allows clients to perform CRUD operations via an HTTP API. We use JDBC to persist our data in a PostGreSQL database, and Javalin to build our RESTful API. Clients can register, login, deposit, withdraw, and transfer money between accounts.http

* Developed CRUD operations for user and account management.
* Set up and maintained the PostgreSQL database.
* Implemented authentication and authorization for user login and registration.
* Created endpoints for transactions, including deposit, withdrawal, and transfer.
* Conducted thorough testing using Postman to ensure API functionality.
